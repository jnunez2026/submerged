                    <p>
                        After lunch today at the gymnasium, nothing happened at all.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Once Batches 2028, 2027, and 2026 had established their talents and
                        their presence in the campus, the day was over because nothing happened
                        after lunch at the gymnasium today.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Today, being scheduled for only the Music Practical Tests, was a half-day
                        due to the fact that nothing happened after lunch at the gymnasium today.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm like 80 percent sure that nothing happened after lunch at the gymnasium
                        today, and that's a big number.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        No dances, no Physical Education matters, and nothing at all happened after
                        lunch at the gymnasium, letting Batch 2025 keep their dignity, not that
                        they've lost it since they didn't even do anything nor were they required
                        to.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Nothing happened after lunch at the gymnasium today.
