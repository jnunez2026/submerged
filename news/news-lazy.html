                <div id="content-body">
                    <p>
                        I'm not even sure if this is newsworthy, but I wrote this just to
                        calm you all down.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        An inconspicuous, unidentified scholar has been gently lying down on
                        the garden behind the Academic Building 1 for the last nine days.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The slothed individual refused to go up to eat, drink, shower, study,
                        or go home for the entirety of the time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Due to this, dried blood stained the grass maroon while pungent methane
                        filled the air, all coming from their body.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It's kind of rude, frankly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Two other scholars, who wished to remain anonymous, also voiced their
                        opinions to our industrious editor.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The first one, being the pet of every teacher, reacted in disgust, stating
                        "I work myself to death everyday, and letting this person just fool around
                        invalidates all of my effort, and I think everyone else's as well."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, the other one with straight 1.00's had a relatively tamer
                        approach, preaching that "everybody needs rest," but that "this is just
                        too much."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The school tried contacting the scholar's father, but unfortunately, all
                        attempts were unsuccessful.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, everyone is puzzled as to what to do with this disturbance.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I personally think that they should just drink coffee, to be honest.
