                    <p>
                        At around 9:40 AM this morning, rhythmic hissing scattered around the
                        Academic Building 3 as a group of scholars organized an ambush against
                        beloved Computer Science teacher, Sir Jan Michael Ibanez.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Thankfully, Sir JM managed to not sustain any injuries, the angel that
                        he is.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, the deadline to the 1st Quarter Magazine Website Project was
                        still set back to November 2, 2022 due to shock.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ma'am Charisse Mendoza, a fellow teacher, deducted that the scholars might
                        have gathered under the table from the allure of the donuts mysteriously
                        placed there by an unknown donor.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Both teachers secured their own donuts while most of it got ravaged to be
                        used as a distraction for their escape.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Experts advised teachers to be wary of any future attacks from these
                        gremlins. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

                    <p>
                        P.S. Seriously though, happy birthday po Sir JM! Your classes are always
                        fun po and very much worth the trek from one building to another. I'll be
                        maximizing this deadline extension po so I can write even more nonsensical
                        articles. We all wish you many more years of fulfillment as a teacher and
                        as a wonderful person in general. Thank you po!
