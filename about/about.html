                    I'm a scholar from 9-Samat, Batch 2026. My MBTI personality type is ENTP.
                    I like my music powerful in meaning and in headbanging. My favorite colors
                    lie within cyan to violet in the color wheel. I'm also interested in a lot
                    of things, including the usual stuff like movies, gaming, and food, but
                    also particularly writing and memes. I pride myself in my intuition and
                    creativity. I halfly pride myself in my broken humor.

                    This is my submission for the Computer Science 3, 1st Quarter Project:
                    my eldritch Pandora's box. It is a satirical news website born from
                    the traits I've said earlier. I've chosen the Lovecraftian deep sea as
                    the setting for this joyride as a stand-in for the forbidden knowledge
                    trope, replacing the cursed with the comical. Most of the images were
                    made by yours truly using Canva and Photoshop. Meanwhile, the photo above
                    was taken by Charles Daniel Bundalian, a classmate and close friend of mine.
                    It was conceived with both reasons of exploring my skills and of just
                    messing around in mind. Proceed with caution.
