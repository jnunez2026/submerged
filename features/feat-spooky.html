                        Maize burned and its blaze crackled at the second floor of the Academic
                        Building 1, earlier this noon of October 28, 2022. As prehistoric beasts
                        are brought back from the dead and the fictional world converges with
                        ours, along with many other apocalypses, one particular door had the
                        bodies lining up. This was the most frightening faculty stall today; the
                        Languages Unit.
                    </p>

                        Costume Day 2022 marked the week's calendar back when an email popped up
                        in every scholar's inbox. With the exams approaching, we were told to toss
                        aside the stress and put up the dress. However, while scholars color the
                        halls in every hue of the rainbow, Filipino and English teachers set the
                        mood into monochromatic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Starting from a trick <em>and</em> treat in one, booming corn hurled,
                        only being stopped by glass. These teachers appeared to be witches as
                        they raised the seeds and bulged their flesh outwards with the twist of
                        a hand. Afterwards, the scalding carcasses were served in paper bags,
                        somehow expected to have been enjoyed. Sweets were also solicited as if
                        to fatten us for baking.
                    </p>

                        Moreover, the servers brought no less shock as well. Because the devilish
                        food wasn't enough to burn our tongues, they also brought eye candy to
                        water our eyes. Alongside super-powered minions under the guise of
                        children, scholars were confronted with their worst enemyâ€”their own minds.
                        A simple representation of the fact that we're all lonely is enough to
                        shred a teen's heart to pieces. Indeed, it was simple, but it was also
                        cruel yet astonishingly effective at the same time.
                    </p>

                        As our lack of preparation holds us back from embracing the spookiness,
                        the Languages Unit threw us beyond forward, almost plunging to the ground
                        head-first. Similarly, for those who actually dressed up, we almost
                        literally wore our hearts on our sleeves. These gave a terrifying and
                        terrific reminder that it is in times like this, we must step back for a
                        bit and ask ourselves the real questions. Who or what are we studying for?
                        Where do we see ourselves in the future? Most vitally, why do I always
                        cry whenever I see a happy couple?
